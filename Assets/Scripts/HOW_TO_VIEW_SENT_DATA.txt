HOW TO VIEW DATA SENT TO API
================================================================================

YES - Clicking "Connect Device" DOES send data to your API URL automatically!
Data is sent every 2 seconds while the device is connected.

================================================================================
IMPORTANT: YOU CAN'T VIEW DATA BY VISITING THE URL
================================================================================

The API URL is an ENDPOINT, not a webpage:
https://script.google.com/macros/s/AKfycbwOIWUdbLHsMl4Bwgh8TiauBvPQKVOy7XEFXy6grauL8V55qaFS0D4xtKoTtXmJCAnmGw/exec

This URL:
✓ Receives data (when you send it)
✓ Processes data (saves it to database/Sheets)
✓ Returns a response (success/error)

This URL does NOT:
✗ Show you the data when you visit it in a browser
✗ Display a list of all sent data
✗ Act as a data viewer

================================================================================
HOW TO VERIFY DATA IS BEING SENT
================================================================================

METHOD 1: Check Unity Console
------------------------------
When you click "Connect Device", watch the Console for:
[API] ✓ Data sent successfully to API | Patient: XXX | Pulse: XX.X

This appears every 2 seconds when data is sent successfully.

If you see errors like:
[API] ✗ Submit failed: ...
Then data is NOT being sent (check API URL and setup).

METHOD 2: Check Google Apps Script Execution Logs
--------------------------------------------------
1. Open your Google Apps Script project
2. Click "Executions" (clock icon on left)
3. You should see execution logs showing:
   - When requests arrive
   - What data was received
   - Any errors

METHOD 3: Check Google Sheets (if your script uses Sheets)
-----------------------------------------------------------
1. Open the Google Sheet your script writes to
2. You should see new rows being added every 2 seconds
3. Each row = one data submission

================================================================================
HOW TO VIEW THE STORED DATA
================================================================================

OPTION 1: Use getPatientData Action (Recommended)
--------------------------------------------------
Your API supports "getPatientData" action. You can:
1. Use the Refresh button in Unity (it calls getPatientData)
2. Or manually call the API with:
   https://script.google.com/macros/s/.../exec?action=getPatientData&patientId=YOUR_PATIENT_ID

OPTION 2: Check Google Sheets
------------------------------
If your Google Apps Script saves data to a Google Sheet:
1. Open that Google Sheet
2. You'll see all the data there
3. Each row = one data submission with timestamp

OPTION 3: Check Google Apps Script Logs
----------------------------------------
1. Open Google Apps Script
2. Go to "Executions" tab
3. Click on an execution to see:
   - What data was received
   - What was processed
   - Any errors

================================================================================
WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU CLICK "CONNECT DEVICE"
================================================================================

1. Button shows "Connected!"
2. Every 2 seconds:
   → Generate random data
   → Send data to API URL (POST request with JSON)
   → API receives data and saves it
   → API returns success/error response
   → Unity logs the result

3. Data is stored in:
   - Google Sheets (if your script uses Sheets)
   - OR in the script's database/memory

4. You can retrieve data later using:
   - Refresh button (calls getPatientData)
   - Or manually query the API

================================================================================
HOW TO TEST IF DATA IS BEING SENT
================================================================================

STEP 1: Click "Connect Device"
STEP 2: Watch Unity Console
STEP 3: You should see every 2 seconds:
   [API] ✓ Data sent successfully to API | Patient: XXX | Pulse: XX.X

If you see this message = Data IS being sent! ✓

If you see error messages = Data is NOT being sent ✗

================================================================================
SUMMARY
================================================================================

✓ YES - Connect Device sends data to API URL automatically
✓ Data is sent every 2 seconds
✓ You can verify in Unity Console (look for [API] messages)
✓ Data is stored in Google Sheets or script database
✓ You CAN'T view data by visiting the URL (it's an endpoint, not a webpage)
✓ To view data: Check Google Sheets OR use Refresh button (getPatientData)
