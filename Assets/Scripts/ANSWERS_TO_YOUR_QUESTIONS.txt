ANSWERS TO YOUR QUESTIONS
================================================================================

Q1: "Response is not JSON format. Treating as success" - Is this a mistake?
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
NO, this is NOT a mistake! It's just a WARNING, not an error.

What it means:
- Your API successfully received the data
- The API responded, but not in JSON format (maybe HTML or plain text)
- The script treats this as SUCCESS because the HTTP request worked
- Your data WAS sent successfully!

This is common with Google Apps Script - sometimes it returns HTML or 
empty responses instead of JSON. The important thing is: your data was sent!

You can ignore this warning - it's working correctly.

Q2: How long will the line graph plot? I didn't see anything.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
The graph plots data in REAL-TIME as it comes in.

HOW IT WORKS:
- When you click "Connect Device", data is generated every 2 seconds
- Each time data is generated, it's added to the graph
- The graph shows the LAST 24 data points (about 48 seconds of data at 2-second intervals)
- Graph updates automatically every time new data arrives

WHY YOU MIGHT NOT SEE IT:
1. You need at least 2 data points for a line to appear
2. Make sure "Toggle All" is ON (or at least one toggle is ON)
3. Make sure GraphContainer has LineGraphRenderer component
4. Make sure graphContainer field is assigned in LineGraphRenderer
5. Wait a few seconds after connecting device for data to accumulate

TO SEE THE GRAPH:
1. Click "Connect Device" button
2. Wait 4-6 seconds (need at least 2-3 data points)
3. Check that toggles are ON
4. The graph should appear automatically

GRAPH DURATION:
- Shows last 24 data points
- At 2-second intervals = 48 seconds of data
- Old data is automatically removed when new data arrives
- Graph continuously updates in real-time

================================================================================

Q3: Is Export Report button the one that sends info?
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
NO! The Export Report button does NOT send data to the API.

WHAT SENDS DATA:
- Clicking "Connect Device" button sends data automatically
- Data is sent every 2 seconds while device is connected
- You don't need to click Export Report to send data

WHAT EXPORT REPORT DOES:
- It's meant to EXPORT a report file (PDF/CSV) of the current data
- This feature is NOT yet implemented (it's a placeholder)
- It does NOT send data to the API
- Right now it just logs data to console

DATA FLOW:
1. Click "Connect Device" → Starts sending data every 2 seconds
2. Data is automatically sent to API
3. Data appears on dashboard
4. Export Report → Would export a file (not implemented yet)

================================================================================

Q4: Do I need to change the API URL link?
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
MAYBE - It depends on your Google Apps Script setup.

CURRENT URL IN SCRIPT:
https://script.google.com/macros/s/AKfycbwOIWUdbLHsMl4Bwgh8TiauBvPQKVOy7XEFXy6grauL8V55qaFS0D4xtKoTtXmJCAnmGw/exec

HOW TO CHECK IF YOU NEED TO CHANGE IT:
1. Open your Google Apps Script project
2. Go to "Deploy" → "Manage deployments"
3. Copy the "Web app URL"
4. Compare it with the URL in the script
5. If they're different, update the script

HOW TO UPDATE THE URL:
1. In Unity, select the GameObject with PatientDataAPI component
2. In Inspector, find "Api Url" field
3. Paste your correct Google Apps Script Web App URL
4. Make sure the URL ends with "/exec"

IMPORTANT:
- The URL must be the Web App URL (not the script editor URL)
- The URL must have "/exec" at the end
- Make sure your Google Apps Script is deployed as a Web App
- Make sure "Execute as: Me" and "Who has access: Anyone" is set

================================================================================

Q5: What is "Test Patient Id"?
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
"Test Patient Id" is a DEFAULT patient ID used for testing.

WHAT IT IS:
- A default patient ID: "PT-1234567890-ABCDE"
- Used when no patient ID is entered
- Can be changed in the Inspector

WHERE IT'S USED:
- In PatientDataAPI component
- Used as fallback if no patient ID is provided
- Used for testing/development

HOW TO CHANGE IT:
1. Select GameObject with PatientDataAPI component
2. In Inspector, find "Test Patient Id" field
3. Type your desired patient ID
4. This will be used if no patient ID is entered in the UI

HOW IT WORKS IN YOUR APP:
1. User enters Patient ID in the input field → Uses that ID
2. User skips/doesn't enter ID → Uses "Test Patient Id" from API component
3. Patient ID is saved in PlayerPrefs → Loaded next time

RECOMMENDATION:
- Keep it as default for testing
- Or change it to a real patient ID format you use
- The actual patient ID comes from the Patient Input Panel

================================================================================
SUMMARY
================================================================================

1. "Response is not JSON" = NOT an error, data was sent successfully ✓
2. Graph plots in real-time, shows last 24 points, wait 4-6 seconds to see it
3. Export Report = Does NOT send data, Connect Device button sends data
4. API URL = Check if it matches your Google Apps Script Web App URL
5. Test Patient Id = Default ID for testing, can be changed in Inspector

================================================================================
TROUBLESHOOTING CHECKLIST
================================================================================

If graph doesn't show:
□ Clicked "Connect Device" button
□ Waited at least 4-6 seconds
□ Checked that "Toggle All" is ON
□ Verified GraphContainer has LineGraphRenderer component
□ Verified graphContainer field is assigned
□ Checked Console for "Graph data points" log messages

If data doesn't send:
□ Verified API URL is correct
□ Checked that PatientDataAPI component is assigned
□ Verified patient ID is set
□ Checked Console for "SENDING DATA TO API" messages
□ Verified Google Apps Script is deployed as Web App
