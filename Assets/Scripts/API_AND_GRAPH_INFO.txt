API URL AND DATA STORAGE - IMPORTANT INFORMATION
================================================================================

Q: Is the data I sent appearing in the API URL link?
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

NO - The link you provided is just a TEST/ECHO endpoint, not where data is stored.

The actual API URL in your script is:
https://script.google.com/macros/s/AKfycbwOIWUdbLHsMl4Bwgh8TiauBvPQKVOy7XEFXy6grauL8V55qaFS0D4xtKoTtXmJCAnmGw/exec

This is your Google Apps Script Web App URL. The data is stored in:
- Google Sheets (if your script uses Sheets)
- Or in the script's memory/database

To see your data:
1. Check your Google Sheets (if the script saves to Sheets)
2. Use the "getPatientData" action to retrieve data
3. Check the Google Apps Script execution logs

The echo/test URL you found is just for testing API connectivity, not for viewing data.

================================================================================
API ACTION FIXED
================================================================================

I've changed the action from "submitData" to "addPatient" because your API 
only supports these actions:
- login
- getPatients  
- getPatientData
- addPatient  ← This is what we use to submit data
- removePatient

The script now uses "addPatient" action, so it should work correctly now!

GRAPH INFORMATION - IT'S ALREADY A LINE GRAPH!
================================================================================

Your graph IS a line graph! Here's how it works:

HOW IT WORKS:
-------------
1. The LineGraphRenderer creates a line graph using Unity UI
2. It draws lines by creating small Image segments between data points
3. Each line connects all the data points smoothly
4. Multiple lines can be shown (Pulse, Movement, Sleep) with different colors
5. The graph automatically scales to fit all data

VISUAL FEATURES:
----------------
✓ Grid lines (horizontal and vertical) for easy reading
✓ Multiple colored lines (Blue for Pulse, Cyan for Movement, Yellow for Sleep)
✓ Automatic scaling (fits data to graph area)
✓ Smooth line connections between points
✓ Filter toggles (All, Pulse, Movement, Sleep)

GRAPH APPEARANCE:
-----------------
- Background: White with light gray grid
- Pulse Line: Blue (#3366FF)
- Movement Line: Cyan/Light Blue (#4DCCE6)
- Sleep Line: Yellow/Orange (#FFCC33)
- Line Width: 3 pixels (adjustable in Inspector)
- Grid: 10x10 lines (adjustable)

HOW TO USE:
-----------
1. Make sure GraphContainer has LineGraphRenderer component
2. Assign GraphContainer's RectTransform to "Graph Container" field
3. Data will automatically appear when you connect device
4. Use toggles to show/hide different data lines

TROUBLESHOOTING GRAPH
================================================================================

Problem: Graph doesn't show
Solution: 
- Make sure GraphContainer has LineGraphRenderer component
- Make sure graphContainer field is assigned
- Make sure you have data (connect device first)

Problem: Lines look jagged
Solution: 
- This is normal - lines are made of segments
- Increase lineWidth in Inspector for smoother look
- Add more data points for smoother curves

Problem: Graph is empty
Solution:
- Connect device to generate data
- Check that data is being added to pulseData, movementData, sleepData lists
- Make sure toggles are ON (at least one should be checked)
